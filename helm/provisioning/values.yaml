  # "Always" => Every time the kubelet launches a container, the kubelet queries the container image registry to
  #             resolve the name to an image digest. If the kubelet has a container image with that exact digest cached
  #             locally, the kubelet uses its cached image; otherwise, the kubelet pulls the image with the resolved
  #             digest, and uses that image to launch the container.
  # "Never" => The kubelet does not try fetching the image. If the image is somehow already present locally, the
  #            kubelet attempts to start the container; otherwise, startup fails.
